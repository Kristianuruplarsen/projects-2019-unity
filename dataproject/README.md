# Dataproject

For our project we have chosen to analyse historical stock data from the yahoo-database 
We will base our analysis on a book by Lars Tvede aobut the 'golden' and 'dead' cross.

To produce our result one only needs to open the dataProject.ipynb file (located in projects-2019-unity/dataproject) which produces and shows the result, in code made specificly for Jupyter Notebook. 
This code relies heavily on functions defined in the funtions.py file (located in projects-2019-unity/dataproject/dataproject/). In this file we have defined funtion that download the data from yahoo and also that plots the data in an interactive way. The functions are very versatile a can take all the stocks and years located in the Yahoo database. 

Aditionally in making our graph we have relied heavily on the bokeh visualization library, so it will be necesary to 'pip install bokeh' or 'conda install bokeh' before trying to run the files. 

Best regards
